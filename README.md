Vim Markdown Table of Contents Plugin
=============
  this vim plugin creates a table of contents for markdown file based on headers.
  you can remove and update contents. it uses a script written in python2.

    Note: only Atx-style headers are supported.

## Usage
    :MarkCont       creates contents below the currnt line.
    :MarkRemove     removes contets generated by this plugin.
    :MarkUpdate     updates the contents if the file has been changed.
    :MarkGoto       shows the content in file if cursor is on contents list

you can change title for table of contents with `g:markcont-title`.

contents are standard markdown links which can be translated to html with markdown tools.

  ```
      Title
      =============
      # Header1
      ##Header1a
      # Headr2  #
      # Header3
      # Header number three
      ### header ###
  ```
the table will be something like:

  ```
    Table of Contents
    -------------
       - [Header1](#header1)
           - [Header1a](#header1a)
       - [Headr2](#headr2)
